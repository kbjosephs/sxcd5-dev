  <meta name="description" content="@elotroalex reads "the other Alex" in Spanish. Although the handler carries hints of Borges, Marti and the big Other, I get it mostly from my grandmother Flor. Every time I misbehaved she used to say: "Yo se que no fuiste tu, mijo. Fue el otro Alex." Let's say I keep it as a reminder of the playful mischief of grace.

into the study of Caribbean and African literature. Her recent book,<em>“I
and I”: Epitaphs for the Self in the Work of V.S. Naipaul, Kamau
Brathwaite, and Derek Walcott</em>, looks at how these three famous
Caribbean writers attempt to consolidate their literary legacies in
their later works. She is focused now on two new projects. The first,
“Amital Queer: Aunts, Aunty Men and other Anansis, explores how
Caribbean writers use the idea of the cross-gendered aunt (“tantie”) of
oral performance to both subvert and support class and gender
boundaries. The second project entitled “Corporeal States: Body, Nation,
Text,” argues that using gendered metaphors to shore up the identity of
the nation state in African literature may have the unintended
consequence of destabilizing our assumptions about what constitutes a
body and what defines a text.</p>
